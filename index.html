      <h2>Coffee</h2>
      <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants
        in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted
        green coffee. </p>

      <h2>Is it okay to drink coffee everyday?</h2>
      <p>Like so many foods and nutrients, too much coffee can cause problems, especially in the digestive tract. But
        studies have shown that drinking up to four 8-ounce cups of coffee per day is safe. Sticking to those boundaries
        shouldn't be hard for coffee drinkers in the U.S., since most drink just a cup of java per day.</p>
